# WAIT_FOR_USER_INPUT true/false allows you to enable/disable user confirmation upon
#   graceful script ending.
# RESTART true/false allows you to enable/disable automatically restarting the server
#   should it crash.
# SKIP_JAVA_CHECK true/false allows you to disable/enable the compatibility check
#   of your Minecraft version and the provided Java version, as well as the automatic
#   installation of a compatible Java version, should JAVA be set to 'java'.
# JDK_VENDOR is for the automatic installation of a JDK compatible with the Minecraft
#   version of your server pack. For an extensive list of available vendors, check out
#   https://github.com/Jabba-Team/index/blob/main/index.json
#   Note - For the installation to take place:
#   - SKIP_JAVA_CHECK must be set to 'false'
#   - JAVA be set to 'java'
#   - No 'java' command be available OR
#   - The available Java version behind 'java' be incompatible with your Minecraft version.
# JABBA_VERSION has no effect on the installation of Jabba when using PowerShell.
# MINECRAFT_VERSION is tightly coupled with the modloader version. Be careful when changing this, as the new
#   new version you set may not be compatible with the modloader and modloader version combination.
# MODLOADER and MODLOADER_VERSION same thing as with MINECRAFT_VERSION. Changing any of these three values may
#   have unforseen consequences. Well, I say unforseen, it mostly causes the server to straight up not start,
#   because of incompatibilities. Be very careful when changing these!
#
# DO NOT EDIT THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES MANUALLY
#   - FABRIC_INSTALLER_VERSION
#   - QUILT_INSTALLER_VERSION
#   - LEGACYFABRIC_INSTALLER_VERSION
#
# Variables are not reloaded between automatic restarts. If you've made changes to your
#   variables and you want them to take effect, stop the server and script, then
#   re-run it.
